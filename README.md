# Nanodegree Program Structure

As a student in the Machine Learning Nanodegree program, you will build the projects listed below. Each project has a supporting course. Reviewers will provide feedback on your projects and guidance on how to take your project to the next level.

Note: Unless otherwise mentioned in the individual project descriptions, you will need to implement your projects in Python 2.7. Familiarity with numerical and scientific computing libraries like NumPy and SciPy will be very helpful.

## Project 1: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and you want to be the best real estate agent in the area. To compete with your peers, you decide to leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist you and a client with finding the best selling price for their home. Luckily, you’ve come across the Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. Your task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then used to estimate the best selling price for your client’s home.

The supporting course covers: Statistics Review & Supporting Libraries, Evaluating Model Performance, Model Evaluation & Validation, and Model Optimization.

## Project 2: Building a Student Intervention System

As education has grown to rely more and more on technology, more and more data is available for examination and prediction. Logs of student activities, grades, interactions with teachers and fellow students, and more are now available in real time. Educators are after new ways to predict success and failure early enough to stage effective interventions, as well as to identify the effectiveness of different interventions. Toward that end, your goal is to model the factors that predict how likely a student is to pass their high school final exam.

The supporting course covers: Supervised Learning Intro, Decision Trees, Regression, Neural Networks, Kernel Methods, Instance Based Learning, Bayesian Learning, Ensemble Learning.

## Project 3: Creating Customer Segments

Most of the data one collects doesn’t necessarily fit into nice, labeled categories. Many times not only is data not labeled, but categories are unknown! In this project we will take unstructured data, and then attempt to understand the patterns and natural categories that the data fits into. First you’ll learn about methods that are useful for dealing with data without labels, then you’ll apply this to a dataset of your choice, learning what natural categories sit inside it.

The supporting course covers: Clustering, Feature Scaling, Feature Selection, Feature Transformation, Semi-Supervised Learning.

## Project 4: Train a Smartcab to Drive

A smartcab is a self-driving car from the not-so-distant future that ferries people from one arbitrary location to another. In this project, you will use reinforcement learning to train a smartcab how to drive.

The supporting course covers: Markov Decision Processes, Reinforcement Learning, and Game Theory.

## Project 5: Capstone Project

In the capstone project for this Nanodegree program you’ll leverage what you’ve learned in the first four projects and apply multiple learning techniques to design an application to solve a problem of your own choice. Suggested application areas include:
* Deep Learning
* Artificial Intelligence for Robotics
* Plotting and Navigating a Virtual Maze
* Healthcare
* Education
* Computer Vision
* Investment and Trading
